## My process

  My process was planning how to center a container and watch a blog and tutorial how to apply it and many solutions that I encounter which is also great but I also use FLexbox for this challenge
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

When I first commit this solution some say need to use mobile-approach style so for the next challenge I'm going to learn about this. I use stackoverflow to find a solution why border-radius is not working and it's need to use a property overflow:hidden.Lastly, Gladly realize how important to use semantic layout.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Best (and worst!) ways to center WITHOUT flex or grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87YMCtsBoCM) - This helped me for this challenge. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Reason for why overflow happen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10995294/border-radius-not-working) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand about overflow.
